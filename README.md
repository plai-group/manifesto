# PLAI Group Manifesto and FAQ

## Mission and Priorities

The Programming Languages and Artificial Intelligence (PLAI) group is a research group dedicated to the pursuit of general purpose artificial intelligence.  Technology-rich spin-off entrepreneurial activity is encouraged as a by-product.

## Student Goals

We are first and foremost an academic lab.  To fit in the PLAI group your career goal prioritization must be to be, in this order, an academic, entrepreneur, or industrial research scientist.  Deviations from this prioritization or having a different goal means that you should probably leave the program.  Pursuing a PhD is a waste of your time and money if these are not your goals, and may well be even if they are.

## Guidelines and Standards

You are expected to complete your PhD in 5 years plus or minus one year.  In order to be competitive on the world job- and fund-raising markets you should have at least 5 _accepted_ papers by the time you graduate.  The acceptance rate at major machine learning conferences is approximately 20%.  PLAI group acceptance rates are significantly higher, especially so if you count resubmissions.  Do the math.  This means you should plan to submit somewhere between 5 and 25 papers during your PhD.  Note that we simply do not submit papers to lower tier conferences and venues (AISTATS, NIPS, ICML, ICLR are the preferred conference venues; UAI, IJCAI, AAAI, ECML are acceptable -- so too top tier vision and NLP conferences).

## University and Departmental Processes

It is your responsibility to understand, track, and meet departmental guidelines and shepherd yourself through the beaurocratic procedures.  I am here to help you with your research and personal development.  I am and will remain ignorant of most processes.
