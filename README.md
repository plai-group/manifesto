# PLAI Group Manifesto and FAQ

## Mission and Priorities

The Programming Languages and Artificial Intelligence (PLAI) group is a research group dedicated to the pursuit of general purpose artificial intelligence.  Technology-rich spin-off entrepreneurial activity is encouraged as a by-product.

## Student Goals

We are first and foremost an academic lab.  To fit in the PLAI group your career goal prioritization must be to be, in this order, an academic, entrepreneur, or industrial research scientist.  Deviations from this prioritization or having a different goal means that you should probably leave the program.  Pursuing a PhD is a waste of your time and money if these are not your goals, and may well be even if they are.  There are more PhD graduates than academic jobs, however, PLAI group alumni have done well on the academic market and will continue to do well.

## Guidelines and Standards

You are expected to complete your PhD in 5 years plus or minus one year.  In order to be competitive on the world job- and fund-raising markets you should have at least 5 _accepted_ papers by the time you graduate.  The acceptance rate at major machine learning conferences is approximately 20%.  PLAI group acceptance rates are significantly higher, especially so if you count resubmissions.  Do the math.  This means you should plan to submit somewhere between 5 and 25 papers during your PhD.  Note that we simply do not submit papers to lower tier conferences and venues (AISTATS, NIPS, ICML, ICLR are the preferred conference venues; UAI, IJCAI, AAAI, ECML are acceptable -- so too top tier vision and NLP conferences).  Journal submissions can be discussed on an ad hoc basis.  I have a strong preference for journals that do not impose a paywall, for instance JMLR and FTML.

## To Be Explicit : The Academic Faustian Bargain

My goals: achieve AI, do world-class research, generate societally noticable impact, generate sufficient funding to sustain and grow my laboratory, get a boatload of citations, make money on the side, and attract new and excellent students and postdoctoral researchers.

Your goal: get a PhD by working on research ideas, writing papers, getting them published, garnering attention, etc.

I cannot achieve my aims alone and have to work through my students and postdocs.  You cannot achieve your aim without partnering with a faculty member, in your case, me.

My job is to get you to where you want to be in life and I will work hard with you to do that.  This always means getting you to the forefront of our research discipline and helping you to craft a research story and vision that, in totality, yields a world-class dissertation-worthy body of work.  What you pay for this is lost income and having to put my name on _our_ work.  It falls on both of us to ensure that this never becomes me putting my name on _your_ work.  This is subtle but very important.  It requires some discipline from both of us.  Particularly in the choosing of research topic.  You will inevitably do the coding, the reading, writing, and, ultimately, the idea generation.  It is extremely important that there is sufficient input from me, particularly on the research direction side of things, to ensure both my interest and my contribution to your work are worthy of us calling it _ours_.  

The most important thing I can and will do for you is, at the end, write you a letter of recommendation and expose you to my network.  You will not understand and may not believe the value of that until well after you have become much older.  Academia is one part brutal meritocracy and one part brutal political game.  

## Meeting Scheduling And Management

There is a group calendar [https://calendar.google.com/calendar/ical/k4jgdu3ee4o7mi9ef8dbkrdnj0%40group.calendar.google.com/private-818c0ce15bc18c1bcac1f3cb4d98f93b/basic.ics](calendar) which _you_ are responsible for watching, adding and removing meetings from, etc.

There will be a weekly group meeting which will consist of paper-reading, guest lectures, practice talks, brainstorming, etc.  You are _required_ to participate in weekly group meeting.

## Collaboration Method

The agenda of our one hour weekly meeting is to be 5% administrivia and 95% current research progress.  I should have access to a current project repository in which paper-formatted LaTeX notes can be found, compiled, and (by me) read.  I will pull said repository in advance of said meeting and read/skim it in order to catch myself up on your work and then the remainder of our meeting can and should be spent at a board working through a problem, transitioning at about a year from me teaching you to you teaching me. 

## My Management Style

I am always too busy.  Please 

### What Pisses Me Off

1. Taking holiday at inappropriate times.
2. Not working hard.
3. Lying. 
4. Having a poor attitude.
5. Not playing hard.
6. Not doing world-class work.
7. Holding meetings that have no research content.
8. Playing politics.
9. Not working well with others.
10. Poor writing.
11. Not contributing positively to the group dynamic.
12. Not volunteering and leading group activities.
13. Not having enough time to edit papers.
14. Playing copy-editor rather than content-editor.
15. Not removing meetings from calendars that won't happen.
16. Wasting my time.



You may not submit work with my name on it without proper notification.    

## University and Departmental Processes

It is your responsibility to understand, track, and meet departmental guidelines and shepherd yourself through the beaurocratic procedures.  I am here to help you with your research and personal development.  I am and will remain and best forgetful and more realistically ignorant of most departmental and university processes.  I refer you to the [CS department PhD handbook](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/students/grad/policies/grad-handbook/phd-program).  Let this be your friend and guide.

## FAQ

1. Can I go to ICML/ICLR/AISTATS/UAI?
  a. Do you have a paper accepted there?  Yes.
  b. Do you _not_ have a paper accepted there?  No.
2. Should I write a workshop paper and submit it to ICML/ICLR/AISTATS/UAI?
  a. Do you have a paper accepted there?  Yes.
  b. Do you _not_ have a paper accepted there?  Maybe.  This depends on my mood and the laboratory funding level.  Tread cautiously.
3. Can I do an internship?
  a. Yes.  +One+.  Make it a good one.  And do it early, when you are less useful to me and the laboratory, rather than late in your PhD.
4. What is your vacation policy.
  UBC allows [https://www.grad.ubc.ca/current-students/managing-your-program/graduate-student-vacation-policy](15 days).  Your PhD is a _job_; treat it like one.  I will not allow holiday before conferences and other major deadlines.  I strongly encourage holiday after deadlines and after attending major conferences.
